<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic describes how to use BOSH Backup and Restore (BBR) to back up your single master cluster.

To perform a restore of the single master cluster, see [Restore the Single Master Cluster](bbr-restore-cluster.html).

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: This process does not back up the contents of disks that are attached to nodes. 
</p>

## <a id='prereqs'></a> Prerequisites

If you want to use the result of the backup to restore to a destination environment,
verify that the current environment and the destination environment are compatible.
For more information, see [Compatibility of Restore](bbr-restore.html#compatibility).

Before you begin backing up your PKS Cluster deployment, perform the following steps:

1. Download the root CA certificate for your PKS deployment:
  1. From the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard, click your username in the top right corner.
  1. Navigate to <strong>Settings > Advanced</strong>.
  1. Click <strong>Download Root CA Cert</strong>.

1. Locate your PKS Cluster BOSH deployment name:
  1. <%= partial 'login-pks-api' %>
  1. Run `pks cluster CLUSTER-NAME`. From the output of this command, record the following items:
  * **UUID**: This value is your cluster ID associated with the cluster you would like to backup.
  1. From the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard, click the Director tile.
  1. Click the **Credentials** tab.
  1. Navigate to **Bosh Commandline Credentials** and click **Link to Credential**.
  1. Copy the credential value. 
  1. From the command line, run the following command to retrieve your PKS Cluster BOSH deployment name, replacing `BOSH-CLI-CREDENTIALS` with the credential value you copied in the previous step:
  <pre>BOSH-CLI-CREDENTIALS deployments | grep UUID</pre>
  where UUID is the cluster UUID from the above step
  Your PKS Cluster BOSH deployment name begins with `service-instance` and includes a unique identifier.

Perform the following steps to check that your BOSH Director is reachable and has a deployment that can be backed up:

1. SSH into your jumpbox.<br>
   For general information about the jumpbox, see [Install BOSH Backup and Restore](bbr-install.html).

2. Run the BBR pre-backup check:

    <code>BOSH&#95;CLIENT&#95;SECRET=BOSH-CLIENT-SECRET bbr deployment --target BOSH-TARGET --username BOSH-CLIENT --deployment DEPLOYMENT-NAME --ca-cert PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERT pre-backup-check</code>

    <br>Where:<br><br>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th width="30%">Credential</th>
        <th>Location</th>
      </tr><tr>
        <td><code>BOSH-CLIENT-SECRET</code></td>
        <td>In the BOSH Director tile, navigate to <strong>Credentials > Bosh Commandline Credentials</strong>. Record the value for <code>BOSH&#95;CLIENT&#95;SECRET</code>.</td>
      </tr><tr>
        <td><code>BOSH-TARGET</code></td>
        <td>In the BOSH Director tile, navigate to <strong>Credentials > Bosh Commandline Credentials</strong>. Record the value for <code>BOSH&#95;ENVIRONMENT</code>.
        You must be able to reach the target address from the workstation where you run <code>bbr</code> commands.</td>
      </tr><tr>
        <td><code>BOSH-CLIENT</code></td>
        <td>In the BOSH Director tile, navigate to <strong>Credentials > Bosh Commandline Credentials</strong>. Record the value for <code>BOSH&#95;CLIENT</code>.</td>
      </tr><tr>
        <td><code>PATH-TO-BOSH-CA-CERT</code></td>
        <td>Use the path to the root CA certificate you downloaded in the [Prerequisites](#prereqs) section.</td>
      </tr><tr>
        <td><code>DEPLOYMENT-NAME</code></td>
        <td>Use the PKS Cluster BOSH deployment name you located in the [Prerequisites](#prereqs) section.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET=p455w0rd \
    bbr deployment \
    --target bosh.example.com \
    --username admin \
    --deployment cf-acceptance-0 \
    --ca-cert bosh.ca.cert \
    pre-backup-check</pre>

3. If the pre-backup check command fails, do the following:
   + Run the command again adding the `--debug` flag to enable debug logs.<br>
     For more information, see [Exit Codes and Logging](bbr-logging.html).
   + Make the fix suggested in the output and run the pre-backup check again.<br>
     For example, the deployment you selected might not have the correct backup scripts,
     or the connection to the BOSH Director failed.

4. If the pre-backup check succeeds, run the BBR backup command from your jumpbox to back up your BOSH deployment:

    <code>BOSH&#95;CLIENT&#95;SECRET=BOSH-CLIENT-SECRET nohup bbr deployment --target BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP --username BOSH-CLIENT --deployment DEPLOYMENT-NAME --ca-cert PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERT backup</code>

    Replace the placeholder values with the same values as above.<br><br>

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you want to include the manifest in the backup artifact, add the <code>--with-manifest</code> flag. However, be aware that the backup artifact then includes credentials that you must keep secret.</p>

    For example,

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET=p455w0rd \
        nohup bbr deployment \
        --target bosh.example.com \
        --username admin \
        --deployment cf-acceptance-0 \
        --ca-cert bosh.ca.cert \
        backup</pre>

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The BBR backup command can take a long time to complete. You can run it independently of the SSH session so that the process can continue running even if your connection to the jumpbox fails. The command above uses <code>nohup</code>, but you could also run the command in a <code>screen</code> or <code>tmux</code> session.</p>

5. If the command completes successfully, follow the steps in [Good Practices for Managing Your Backup Artifact](#good-practices) below.

6. If the backup command fails, do the following:
   + Run the command again adding the `--debug` flag to enable debug logs. 
     For more information, see [Exit Codes and Logging](bbr-logging.html).
   + Follow the steps in [Recovering from a Failing Command](#recovering-from-failing-command).


## <a id="recovering-from-failing-command"></a>Recovering from a Failing Command

If the backup fails, follow these steps: 

1. Ensure all the parameters in the command are set.
1. Ensure the BOSH Director credentials are valid.
1. If you are backing up a deployment, ensure the deployment you specify in the BBR command exists.
1. Ensure that the jumpbox can reach the BOSH Director.
1. Consult [Exit Codes and Logging](bbr-logging.html).
1. If you see the error message `Directory /var/vcap/store/bbr-backup already exists on instance`,
   run the appropriate cleanup command. See [Clean Up after a Failed Backup](#manual-clean) below.
1. If the backup artifact is corrupted discard the failing artifacts and rerun the backup.


## <a id='cancel-backup'></a>Cancel a Backup

Backups can take a long time.
If you need to cancel a backup, for example if you realize that the backup is going to fail
or that your developers need to push an app in a hurry, follow these steps:

1. Terminate the BBR process by pressing Ctrl-C and typing `yes` to confirm.
1. Because stopping a backup can leave the system in an unusable state and prevent additional backups,
   follow the procedures in [Clean Up after a Failed Backup](#manual-clean) below.

## <a id="manual-clean"></a>Clean Up after a Failed Backup

If your backup process fails, it might leave the BBR backup folder on the instance,
causing any subsequent attempts to backup to fail.
In addition, BBR might not have run the post-backup scripts, leaving the instance in a locked state.

Follow the steps below to use the BBR cleanup script to tidy up after a failed backup attempt.

1. If the PKS Cluster backup failed, run the following command:

    <code>BOSH&#95;CLIENT&#95;SECRET=BOSH-CLIENT-SECRET bbr deployment --target BOSH-TARGET --username BOSH-CLIENT --deployment DEPLOYMENT-NAME --ca-cert PATH-TO-BOSH-CA-CERT backup-cleanup</code>

    For example,

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET=p455w0rd \
    bbr deployment \
    --target bosh.example.com \
    --username admin \
    --deployment cf-acceptance-0 \
    --ca-cert bosh.ca.crt \
    backup-cleanup
    </pre>

1. If the cleanup script fails, consult the following table to match the exit codes to an error message.

    <table>
      <tr>
      <th>Value</th>
      <th>Error</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>Success</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>General failure</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
      <td>8</td>
      <td>The post-backup unlock failed. Your deployment might be in a bad state and require attention.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
      <td>16</td>
      <td>The cleanup failed.
          This is a non-fatal error indicating that the utility has been unable to clean up
          open BOSH SSH connections to the deployment VMs.
          Manual cleanup might be required to clear any hanging BOSH users and connections.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

## <a id="good-practices"></a>Good Practices for Managing Your Backup Artifact

Keep your backup artifact safe by following these steps:

1. Move the backup artifact off the jumpbox to your storage space.

    BBR stores each backup in a subdirectory named `DEPLOYMENT-TIMESTAMP` within the current working directory.
    The backup created by BBR consists of a folder with the backup artifacts and metadata files.

1. Compress and encrypt the backup artifacts when storing them.

1. Make redundant copies of your backup and store them in multiple locations. 

    This minimizes the risk of losing your backups in the event of a disaster.

1. Each time you redeploy PKS Cluster, test your backup artifact 
   by following the procedures in [Restore the Single Master Cluster](bbr-restore-cluster.html).
