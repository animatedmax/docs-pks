<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic describes how platform operators can monitor and retrieve metrics from
master/etcd node VMs in <%= vars.product_full %> deployments.

## <a id="overview"></a>Overview
etcd is an open source distributed key value store.
In <%= vars.product_short %>, etcd is co-located on Kubernetes master node VMs.
The master node VMs use etcd for service discovery and configuration sharing within the cluster.
You can monitor Kubernetes cluster health by using metrics from etcd.

For more information about etcd, see the [etcd documentation](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/tree/master/Documentation) in GitHub.

For more information about configuring master/etcd nodes in the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile, see the
Plans section of _Installing <%= vars.product_short %>_ for your IaaS:

* [vSphere](installing-pks-vsphere.html#plans)
* [vSphere with NSX-T Integration](installing-nsx-t.html#plans)
* [Google Cloud Platform (GCP)](installing-pks-gcp.html#plans)
* [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](installing-pks-aws.html#plans)
* [Azure](installing-pks-azure.html#plans)


## <a id="collect"></a>Collect Metrics Using etcd 

You can configure the Telgraf agent to collect metrics from etcd and send the metrics to a third-party monitoring service. The Telgraf agent can read metrics from the following:

+ a `/metric` endpoint exposed by the etcd VM 
+ the Node Exporter

Node Exporter provides additional infrastructure metrics on the localhost of the master node. For more information, see [node_exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter) in GitHub.  <br><br>

To monitor etcd with a third-party monitoring service, do the following:

1. Create a configuration file for your output plugin. See [Create a Configuration File](#toml)
1. Configure Telegraf in the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile. See [Configure Telegraf in the Tile](#connect). 

For more information about monitoring etcd,
see [Monitoring etcd](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/Documentation/op-guide/monitoring.md)
in GitHub. 

### <a id="toml"></a> Create a Configuration File 

To connect a third-party monitoring service to <%= vars.product_short %>, you must create a configuration file for the service. The configuration file is written in a TOML format and consists of key-value pairs. After you create your configuration file, you can enter the file into the <%= vars.product_tile %> tile to connect the service. 

To create a configuration file your monitoring service, do the following:

1. Locate the required format for your monitoring service in the `README.md` file for your service in [telegraf](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/1.11.0/plugins/outputs) in GitHub. The etcd documentation recommends using the open source Prometheus monitoring service.<br><br>
    For more information about using Prometheus, see 
    [Overview](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/) in the Prometheus documentation.

1. Create your configuration file using the required format of your monitoring service.
For example, if you want to create a configuration file for an HTTP output plugin, create a file similar to the following: 

    ```
    [[outputs.http]]
       url="https://example.com"
       method="POST"
       data_format="JSON"
    [[processors.override]]
      [processors.override.tags]
        director = "bosh-director-1"
    ```
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong>  You can add tags to your configuration file to label etcd metrics. For example, the above code snippet adds a <code>bosh-director-1</code> tag to the etcd metrics. If you have multiple BOSH Directors, Pivotal recommends adding tags to filter your metrics in your monitoring service. </p>

### <a id="connect"></a> Configure Telegraf in the Tile

To connect a monitoring service to etcd, do the following:

1. From the **Ops Manager Installation Dashboard**, navigate to **<%= vars.product_tile %>** >
**Settings** > **Monitoring**.

    ![Monitoring pane](images/monitoring.png)

1. (Optional) If you want to send metrics from Node Exporter, select **Enable Node-Exporter on master**


1. For **Setup Telegraf Outputs**, enter the contents of the configuration file
you created in [Create a Configuration File](#toml) above. 
If you do not want to output any metrics, leave the default value `[[outputs.discard]]`.

1. Click **Save**

1. Click **Apply Changes**.

## <a id="errors"></a>Troubleshoot etcd

Pivotal recommends working with Pivotal or VMware Support to troubleshoot master/etcd node VMs.
The monitoring and metrics data you retrieve from the master/etcd node VMs
can help the Support team diagnose and troubleshoot errors.
